      <div class="abt-content">
      Not long ago in 2020, in the midst of a pandemic, the two of us met serendipitously at work.
      <br>As the popular phrase goes, THE REST IS HISTORYâ€¦
      <br>With the blessings of our families and the love of our friends, we have decided to remain best friends for life.
      <br>The past 6 months has been a wonderful journey and life has taught us so many beautiful lessons. We vow to ensure we keep learning and growing together.
      <br>Come bless us on 14th June as we enter holy matrimony and solemnise the relationship. 
      <br>For those of you who are unable to attend, kindly uphold us in your prayers and we hope to meet you all soon.
      <br>Love,
      <br>Arvind and Dianna</div>
